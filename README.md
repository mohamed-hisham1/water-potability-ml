# Water Quality Prediction System 🌊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **water quality** using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to determine whether water is **safe or unsafe** based on several physicochemical parameters.  
The project also includes a **Streamlit web application** that allows users to interact with the model and make real-time predictions.
